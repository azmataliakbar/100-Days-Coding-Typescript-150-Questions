!Question 22: Intentional Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. Correct the error before finishing.

/*
todo=> Explain & TIP: Array index errors happen when you try to access a position in the array that doesnâ€™t exist. Experimenting with this helps you understand array boundaries.

let friends: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

console.log("\n", friends[3]); // Intentional error: Arrays are zero-indexed, so index 3 is out of bounds/ undefined

friends[2] = "Charlie"; // Correcting the error by accessing a valid index.
console.log("\n", friends[2]);
